# GlusterFS tips and trick and caveats


# When adding a volumem & it complains about 
# (is not in 'Peer in Cluster' state)

1: sudo gluster peer detach <hostname|ip>
2: sudo gluster peer probe <hostname|ip>

3: wait for the motherfucker to add the peer to cluster , 
	or else you will get the dreaded error (Peer not in Cluster)

4: Make sure the peer was added correctly by 
	issuing "sudo gluster peer status" and getting 
	(Peer in Cluster (connected))
