# First method - Squid 
{

	
	sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
	
	# Change

	"(http_access deny all) to (http_access allow all)"



	# Add this to the end , to disable caching and logging
access_log none
cache_store_log none
cache_log /dev/null
logfile_rotate 0


}




# Second method - SSH Socks
{

ssh -D 12345 myuser@remote_ssh_server

	#will open up the port 12345 on your local machine as a 
	#SOCKS proxy

	#Next, set up your browser to use the proxy server. specify that
	#you want to use a Manual Proxy, server=(0.0.0.0) , port 12345 and 
	#SOCKS v5 
	 
}


# Third Method - Polipo
{

 # install
  
  p polipo

 # configure
   
  n /etc/polipo/config

  
 # (create the file and paste all the below text ino it)
{


### Basic configuration
### *******************

# Uncomment one of these if you want to allow remote clients to
# connect:

# proxyAddress = "::0"        # both IPv4 and IPv6
 proxyAddress = "10.0.0.3"    # the host (server) IP

# If you do that, you'll want to restrict the set of hosts allowed to
# connect:

 allowedClients = "0.0.0.0/0"

# allowedClients = "10.0.0.3/24"
# allowedClients = "127.0.0.1, 134.157.168.0/24"

# Uncomment this if you want your Polipo to identify itself by
# something else than the host name:

# proxyName = "polipo.sderawi.dyndns.org"

# Uncomment this if there's only one user using this instance of Polipo:

# cacheIsShared = false

# Uncomment this if you want to use a parent proxy:

# parentProxy = "squid.example.org:3128"

# Uncomment this if you want to use a parent SOCKS proxy:

# socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050"
# socksProxyType = socks5


### Memory
### ******

# Uncomment this if you want Polipo to use a ridiculously small amount
# of memory (a hundred C-64 worth or so):

# chunkHighMark = 819200
# objectHighMark = 128

# Uncomment this if you've got plenty of memory:

# chunkHighMark = 50331648
# objectHighMark = 16384


### On-disk data
### ************

# Uncomment this if you want to disable the on-disk cache:

# diskCacheRoot = ""

# Uncomment this if you want to put the on-disk cache in a
# non-standard location:

# diskCacheRoot = "~/.polipo-cache/"

# Uncomment this if you want to disable the local web server:

# localDocumentRoot = ""

# Uncomment this if you want to enable the pages under /polipo/index?
# and /polipo/servers?.  This is a serious privacy leak if your proxy
# is shared.

# disableIndexing = false
# disableServersList = false


### Domain Name System
### ******************

# Uncomment this if you want to contact IPv4 hosts only (and make DNS
# queries somewhat faster):

 dnsQueryIPv6 = no

# Uncomment this if you want Polipo to prefer IPv4 to IPv6 for
# double-stack hosts:

# dnsQueryIPv6 = reluctantly

# Uncomment this to disable Polipo's DNS resolver and use the system's
# default resolver instead.  If you do that, Polipo will freeze during
# every DNS query:

# dnsUseGethostbyname = yes


###http
### ****

# Uncomment this if you want to enable detection of proxy loops.
# This will cause your hostname (or whatever you put into proxyName
# above) to be included in every request:

# disableVia=false

# Uncomment this if you want to slightly reduce the amount of
# information that you leak about yourself:

# censoredHeaders = from, accept-language
# censorReferer = maybe

# Uncomment this if you're paranoid.  This will break a lot of sites,
# though:

# censoredHeaders = set-cookie, cookie, cookie2, from, accept-language
# censorReferer = true

# Uncomment this if you want to use Poor Man's Multiplexing; increase
# the sizes if you're on a fast line.  They should each amount to a few
# seconds' worth of transfer; if pmmSize is small, you'll want
# pmmFirstSize to be larger.

# Note that PMM is somewhat unreliable.

# pmmFirstSize = 16384
# pmmSize = 8192

# Uncomment this if your user-agent does something reasonable with
# Warning headers (most don't):

# relaxTransparency = maybe

# Uncomment this if you never want to revalidate instances for which
# data is available (this is not a good idea):

# relaxTransparency = yes

# Uncomment this if you have no network:

# proxyOffline = yes

# Uncomment this if you want to avoid revalidating instances with a
# Vary header (this is not a good idea):

# mindlesslyCacheVary = true

allowedPorts = 1-65535
tunnelAllowedPorts = 1-65535
